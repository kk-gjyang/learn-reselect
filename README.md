### Introduction

This project has been built to teach the basics, and value, of the [reselect library](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect#readme).

The app will be a react app implementing redux for global state management. However, it's worth noting that reselect is framework agnostic and can be used in any JavaScript project, or with any state management API (like context).

## Description

This app will be a "movies" app, with a large number of movies (coming from the `src/data/movies.json` directory) being stored in redux.

Initially the app will be set up to display movies by category, and have a search functionality. All of this will be implemented without making use of reselect, and will likely perform very poorly.

Each exercise will be outlined in a markdown file in the `/exercises` directory with the naming convention `<Exercise Number>.md`. The completed files will be stored in the `/final` as a reference for you as you work.


### TODO:
1. implementing reselect -> moving to functions
2. using createSelector
3. flux
4. redux basics
5. redux thunk
6. creating new slice of state
